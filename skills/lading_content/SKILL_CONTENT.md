  Use this skill whenever creating, editing, or reviewing ANY web content, landing pages, UI components,
  marketing copy, pitch decks, presentations, or digital assets for Pro Corp. Trigger this skill when
  the user mentions "Pro Corp", "ProCorp", "landing page", "our website", "our landing", "nuestra web",
  "nuestra landing", or references any of Pro Corp's verticals (Legal Solutions, Sustainable Growth, IP2$),
  the Exchange Platform, BPA, or process re-engineering in a web/content context. Also use when the user
  asks to build, design, or write content that must align with Pro Corp's brand identity, tone, or strategic
  positioning — even if they don't explicitly say "use the brand guidelines." This is the single source of
  truth for Pro Corp's identity, messaging, and web content criteria.

## 1. Who Is Pro Corp

Pro Corp is a **technology-based orchestration company** specialized in Business Process Automation (BPA).

It is NOT a consulting firm. It is NOT a software house. It is NOT a marketplace.

Pro Corp **redesigns operating models, automates execution, and integrates assets, capital, and
expertise** through a transparent exchange platform — amplified by intelligent marketing systems.

Core philosophy:
- Automation without re-engineering is inefficient.
- Re-engineering without execution is theoretical.
- Pro Corp does both.

---

## 2. Strategic Verticals (3 Pillars)

Every page, section, or component must clearly map to one or more of these verticals:

### 2.1 Legal Solutions
Structured governance frameworks, risk architecture, cross-border structuring, compliance workflows.
Enhanced through automation and digital documentation portals. **Not traditional legal services.**

### 2.2 Sustainable Growth
Strategy consulting differentiated by execution. Operating model redesign, KPI systems, financial
simulators, and ongoing operational involvement. **We stay in the game, we don't just advise.**

### 2.3 IP2$ (Engineering Vertical)
Proprietary systems: conversational financial simulators, AI interfaces, marketing automation engines,
platform architecture, Cognitive Echo & narrative engines. **This is where the tech lives.**

## 3. The Exchange Platform

The future integration layer. NOT a marketplace — an **orchestration layer**.

Four participant roles:
| Role                | Function        |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Asset Owners        | Opportunity     |
| Value Enhancers     | Optimization    |
| Capital Providers   | Funding         |
| Execution Managers  | Delivery        |

Pro Corp operates as **Value Enhancer** and **Execution Manager**.

Platform features to highlight:
- Transparent stakeholder portals
- Real-time financial simulations
- Dynamic scenario modeling via conversational interfaces
- Governance documentation
- Operational dashboards
- Risk matrices

Key message: *Complex models become conversational experiences. Technology becomes a bridge — not a barrier.*

## 4. Methodology (7-Step Process)

When showcasing Pro Corp's process on the web:

1. **Diagnose** client pain
2. **Map** the current operating model (OPE Today)
3. **Design** the improved operating model (OPE Tomorrow)
4. **Re-engineer** processes
5. **Implement** through scalable cloud architecture (React, Supabase, Cloud stack)
6. **Integrate** intelligent user interfaces
7. **Amplify** through automated marketing systems

This sequence should be visually represented in landing pages as a flow/journey — never as a flat list.

## 5. Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Voice Attributes
| Attribute       | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authoritative   | Speak with conviction. No hedging, no "we think maybe."     |
| Architectural   | Frame everything as structure, systems, design.               |
| Precise         | Short sentences. Intentional punctuation. No filler.         |
| Forward-looking | We are building what doesn't exist yet — with what does.     |
| Transparent     | We show the mechanism. No black boxes.                        |

### Writing Rules
- Use short declarative sentences. Fragment sentences are encouraged for emphasis.
- Avoid corporate jargon like "synergy", "leverage", "best-in-class."
- Prefer manifesto-style copy over descriptive paragraphs.
- Use line breaks as rhythm — the document itself uses them as a stylistic tool.
- Allowed to be bold, assertive, even provocative.
- Never apologetic. Never uncertain.

### Examples of On-Brand Copy
```
"We design structure."
"We orchestrate execution."
"We bring transparency to capital flow."
"The platform will not be a marketplace. It will be an orchestration layer."
"Momentum is engineered — not accidental."
"Prepared with discipline. Structured for scale. Designed for transparent execution."
```

### Examples of Off-Brand Copy (NEVER use)
```
"We offer a wide range of solutions to help your business grow."
"Our team of experts is here to support you."
"Let us help you achieve your goals."
"We leverage cutting-edge technology to drive synergies."
```

## 6. Marketing Philosophy

Marketing at Pro Corp is **infrastructure, not a department.**

The amplification system generates:
- Structured narratives
- Project interviews
- Educational content
- Social network distribution
- Pre-launch momentum

The funnel: **Visibility → Education → Trust → Capital Flow**

Key principle: *Projects accumulate awareness before capital opens. Momentum is engineered — not accidental.*

---

## 7. Web / Landing Page Content Criteria

When building any Pro Corp landing page, ALWAYS follow these criteria:

### Structure
1. **Hero section**: Bold positioning statement. No generic "welcome" copy. Use manifesto-style language.
2. **Identity block**: What Pro Corp IS (technology-based orchestration) and what it is NOT.
3. **Verticals showcase**: Three distinct sections for Legal Solutions, Sustainable Growth, IP2$.
4. **Methodology journey**: Visual 7-step process (never a flat bullet list).
5. **Exchange Platform preview**: Forward-looking section with platform vision.
6. **Social proof / momentum**: Structured narratives, not testimonials.
7. **CTA**: Direct, confident. No "learn more" — prefer "Enter the platform" or "Start your architecture."

### Visual Direction
- Clean, architectural aesthetic — think blueprint / structural engineering meets fintech.
- Dark mode preferred (charcoal, deep navy) with sharp accent colors (electric blue, white).
- Typography: geometric sans-serif for headings, clean humanist for body.
- Use generous whitespace — the brand breathes through space and rhythm.
- Subtle grid/blueprint patterns or structural motifs as background textures.
- Animations: reveal-on-scroll, staggered entrance. No playful bouncing.
- Data visualizations and diagrams over stock photography.

### Tech Stack Context
Pro Corp builds with: React, Supabase, Cloud stack. The landing should reflect this modernity.

## 8. Positioning Statement (Use Verbatim When Needed)

> Pro Corp is a technology-based orchestration company that redesigns operating models,
> automates execution, and integrates assets, capital, and expertise through a transparent
> exchange platform — amplified by intelligent marketing systems.

Tagline variations:
- "Prepared with discipline. Structured for scale. Designed for transparent execution."
- "We design structure. We orchestrate execution."
- "Automation meets architecture."
